      with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
      clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
      clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
      software under this License.

##    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

      This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
      matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
      unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
      necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
      the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
      the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
      provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
      provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
      to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
      venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
      with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
      limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
      The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
      the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
      regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
      construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
      agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
      States export administration regulations (and the export control
      laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
      or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

##    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

      As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
      responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
      out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
      work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
      responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
      shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
